Lab: Unit Testing
=================

Problems for exercises and homework for the ["C\# OOP" course \@
SoftUni"](https://softuni.bg/trainings/2244/csharp-oop-february-2019).

Part I: Unit Testing Basics
===========================

Test Axe
--------

Load provided solution in Visual Studio. Add new project **Tests**

Create a class **AxeTests**

Create the following tests:

-   Test if weapon loses durability after each attack

-   Test attacking with a broken weapon

### Solution

Test Dummy
----------

Create a class **DummyTests**

Create the following tests:

-   Dummy loses health if attacked

-   Dead Dummy throws exception if attacked

-   Dead Dummy can give XP

-   Alive Dummy can't give XP

### Hints

Follow the logic of the previous problem

Refactor Tests
--------------

Refactor the tests for **Axe** and **Dummy** classes

Make sure that:

-   **Names** of test methods are **descriptive**

-   You use **appropriate assertions** (assert equals vs assert true)

-   You use **assertion messages**

-   There are **no magic numbers**

-   There is **no code duplication** (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)

### Hints

Extract constants and private fields for **Axe** class

Create a method that executes **before each test**

Make use of constants and private fields, as well as add assertion messages

Follow the same logic for other test methods and **TestDummy** class

Part II: Dependencies
=====================

Fake Axe and Dummy
------------------

Test if hero gains XP when target dies

To do this, you need to:

-   Make **Hero** class **testable** (use **Dependency Injection**)

-   Introduce **Interfaces** for Axe and Dummy

    -   Interface Weapon

    -   Interface Target

Create fake Weapon and fake Dummy for the test

### Hints

Create **IWeapon and ITarget** interface. Modify implementation methods to
**make use of interfaces.** Modify both **Axe** and **Dummy** classes.

Use **Dependency Injection** for Hero class

Create **HeroTests** class and test gaining XP functionality by faking Weapon
and Target classes

Mocking
-------

Include **Moq** in the project dependencies, then:

-   Mock fakes from previous problem Hints

Go to **HeroTests** and refactor the code, making use of **Moq**
